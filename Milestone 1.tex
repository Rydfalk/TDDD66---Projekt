\title{Multi-path throughput in mobile networks}

\section{Abstract}

We have made a project about the throughput in multipath networks. Specifically in wifi and bluetooth networks. By analysing and comparing these we have made a few conclusions about strengths and weaknessess for both. We have made some theories about when and where they should be used and a few examples of implementations.

\section{Introduction}

The way we transfer information varies a lot between places and situations. Some techniques work better in certain environments, while they encounter complications in others. People in different countries have different interests, standards and financial potential. Because of all these circumstances affecting mobile networks, it is important to actually study how information flows through them. For instance; in areas with high population density there might be easier to rout data between end users towards an access point, while in sparsely populated areas it might be better with one cellular tower (or even a satellite) for connection. In a lot of central and southern African countries people have access to a phone but no electricity, in such an environment power saving might be a key feature of data transfer, and some power consuming routing options are excluded.

There are certainly many ways to transfer information electronically, however this report is about the different flows of information through different mobile networks for both voice and data. We will evaluate strengths and weaknesses for various techniques including WiFi, GSM, 3G and Bluetooth networks. We will discuss where and how these techniques work best, and how information is distributed through the networks under these conditions. We will in depth present a few of the previously mentioned technologies so they can be carefully evaluated and compared when it comes to routing.


\section{Method}

To do tests based on many nodes it will be very hard and complex for us to do any real tests ourselves. So we intend to use a simulation program.

\section{Time plan}
\begin{description}
\item[Week 38]
Acquire information about how packets flow through different network types. Get a more detailed plan.
\item[Week 39]
Write ~2 pages. Find and learn tools for network simulation. Complete milestone 2
\item[Week 40]
Write ~2 more pages (so ~4 in total). Make first trial simulations
\item[Week 41]
Write ~3 more pages (so ~7 in total). Make sharp simulation. Draw conclusions. Make beautiful diagrams in Excel. Drool over said diagrams.
\item[Week 42]
