\section{Abstract}

We have made a project about the throughput in multipath networks. Specifically in wifi and bluetooth networks. By analysing and comparing these we have made a few conclusions about strengths and weaknessess for both. We have made some theories about when and where they should be used and a few examples of implementations.
